/*
Data Structure / Algorithm:
example problem 1:

UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM:

Input: String
Output: Array (with each paladrome from str as each element)

Explicit:
  - case sensitive
Implicit: (derivied from looking at test case)
  - If no palindrome, return empty array
  - If given an empty string, return empty array
  - palandrom seems to be char > 1
My question: if input string only has one char, is it
considered as paladrome?

I MISSED: will inputs be strings
